# Getting Started with AxonFlow

Welcome to AxonFlow, the enterprise AI control plane providing sub-10ms policy enforcement, multi-agent orchestration, and permission-aware data access for production AI systems.

## What is AxonFlow?

AxonFlow is an enterprise AI governance platform that enables organizations to deploy AI agents safely and at scale. It provides:

- **Sub-10ms Policy Enforcement**: Lightning-fast policy evaluation that doesn't slow down your AI agents
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (MAP)**: Coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel for 40x faster execution
- **MCP v0.2 Connector Ecosystem**: Permission-aware data access through standardized connectors
- **In-VPC Deployment**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Policy-as-Code**: Version-controlled governance policies in your git repository

## Quick Facts

- **Deployment Time**: 15-20 minutes via CloudFormation
- **Deployment Method**: AWS ECS/Fargate (one-click)
- **Target Environment**: Customer VPC (In-VPC deployment)
- **Performance Guarantee**: Sub-10ms P95 latency for policy evaluation
- **Architecture**: Agent (5 tasks) + Orchestrator (10 tasks) + RDS PostgreSQL

## AWS Marketplace Product

AxonFlow is available as a Container product on AWS Marketplace:

## Prerequisites

Before deploying AxonFlow, ensure you have:

### AWS Account Requirements

- Active AWS account with billing enabled
- IAM permissions for CloudFormation stack creation
- AWS Business Support (recommended for production)

### Network Requirements

- Existing VPC with:
  - 2 public subnets (for Application Load Balancer)
  - 2 private subnets (for Fargate tasks and RDS)
  - Subnets in different Availability Zones
- Internet Gateway attached to VPC
- NAT Gateway (optional, for outbound internet access)

### Technical Knowledge

- Familiarity with AWS console and CloudFormation
- Basic understanding of VPC networking
- Understanding of PostgreSQL database management

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Subscribe on AWS Marketplace

1. Go to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)
2. Search for "AxonFlow"
3. Click "Continue to Subscribe"
4. Accept the terms and conditions

### 2. Launch CloudFormation Stack

1. Click "Continue to Configuration"
2. Select your preferred AWS Region
3. Click "Continue to Launch"
4. Choose "Launch CloudFormation"
5. Click "Launch"

### 3. Configure Stack Parameters

**Pricing Configuration:**
- `PricingTier`: Select Pilot, Growth, or Enterprise

**Network Configuration:**
- `VpcId`: Your VPC ID
- `PublicSubnet1`: Public subnet in AZ1
- `PublicSubnet2`: Public subnet in AZ2
- `PrivateSubnet1`: Private subnet in AZ1
- `PrivateSubnet2`: Private subnet in AZ2

**Database Configuration:**
- `DBPassword`: Strong password (minimum 16 characters)
- `DBInstanceClass`: db.t3.medium (default) or larger

**AxonFlow Configuration:**
- `AgentDesiredCount`: Number of Agent tasks (default: 5)
- `OrchestratorDesiredCount`: Number of Orchestrator tasks (default: 10)

### 4. Create Stack

1. Review all parameters
2. Check "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"
3. Click "Create Stack"
4. Wait 15-20 minutes for deployment to complete

### 5. Retrieve Endpoints

After deployment, go to the CloudFormation **Outputs** tab:

- `AgentEndpoint`: Your AxonFlow API endpoint
- `DatabaseEndpoint`: PostgreSQL endpoint
- `ClusterName`: ECS cluster name

**Save these values** - you'll need them for configuration.

## Verify Installation

Test the Agent health endpoint:

```bash
curl -k https://YOUR_AGENT_ENDPOINT/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "components": {
    "database": "connected",
    "orchestrator": "reachable"
  }
}
```

## Architecture Overview

AxonFlow deploys into your VPC with the following components:

- **Agent Tasks (5)**: Policy enforcement engine with sub-10ms P95 latency
- **Orchestrator Tasks (10)**: Multi-agent coordination and MAP execution
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: Audit trail and policy storage (Multi-AZ)
- **Application Load Balancer**: Internal HTTPS endpoint (HTTP/2 + TLS 1.3)
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on CPU utilization
