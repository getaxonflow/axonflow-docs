## Access Control

**Public Docs (docs.getaxonflow.com):**
- Teaser versions in `/docs/examples/`
- Show architecture, value proposition, and CTAs
- No complete implementation code
- Drive AWS Marketplace conversions

**Protected Docs (app.getaxonflow.com/docs):**
- Full implementations in `/docs/examples-protected/`
- Requires AWS Marketplace subscription
- Authentication via license key validation
- Complete source code and deployment guides

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED (Nov 12, 2025)
- Moved full implementations to `examples-protected/`
- Created teaser versions in `examples/`
- Updated public docs to stop competitive exposure

### Phase 2: IN PROGRESS
- Set up app.getaxonflow.com/docs portal
- Implement authentication (license key validation)
- Create customer portal UI
- Deploy protected docs

### Phase 3: PLANNED
- Add more protected examples (fintech, logistics, manufacturing)
- Create video tutorials (customer-only)
- Add interactive code playgrounds
- Build customer community forum

- ✅ SDK documentation
- ✅ Architecture overviews

**Proprietary / Paid:**
- ❌ Healthcare implementation - HIPAA compliance patterns
- ❌ E-commerce implementation - Recommendation algorithms
- ❌ Advanced policy templates
- ❌ Production optimization guides

## Pricing Tiers

### Professional ($15K/month)
